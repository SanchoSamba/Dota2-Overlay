# Dota 2 Minimap and Info Overlay

A lightweight, customizable, and always-on-top overlay built with Electron for Dota 2. It integrates with Dota 2's Game State Integration (GSI) to provide real-time information such as creep wave positions, custom timing notifications, and unreliable gold display, visible only when the game is running.

## ✨ Features

* **Real-time Creep Tracking:** Displays the current position of enemy creep waves on the minimap based on game time, helping with lane timing and pulls.
* **Customizable Notifications:** Set time-based reminders for map events (e.g., Runes, Stack Timers) managed via multiple saveable templates.
* **Live Unreliable Gold Display:** Shows your current unreliable gold total directly on the overlay.
* **GSI Integration:** Utilizes the Dota 2 Game State Integration to pull live data such as game clock, hero status, and team name.
* **Configurable Overlay:**
    * **Resizable:** Easily change the width and height of the overlay/minimap canvas from the dedicated Settings window.
    * **Visibility Modes:** Toggle visibility (Visible, Hidden, or **Focused**—only visible when Dota 2 is the active window) via the system tray icon.
    * **Opacity Control:** Adjust the transparency of the entire overlay via the system tray menu.
* **Waypoint Editor:** Visually adjust creep pathing waypoints and segment timings directly within the Settings panel.
